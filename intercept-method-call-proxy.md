# Proxy and Reflect Solution

**ü•Ç This solution is non-destructive. The object in question is not changed.**

## The solution

- There is no trap to catch a method invocation. You have to use two proxies.
- One to catch property access (could be function), and one to catch function invocation.

## Proxy and Reflect

- Proxy and Reflect objects allow for metaprogramming in JavaScript.
- Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.
- Proxy object intercepts object operations.
- Reflect object simplifies creation of Proxy.
- All of Reflect methods match signature of proxy traps with the same name.

If you add new method to the `myObj` object, you can see the console.log from `handleMethodCall. It flows through the Proxy object.
