# Monkey Patching Solution

**üí• This solution is destructive. It changes the object in question.**

## Monkey patching

- Monkey patching is a technique to add, modify, or suppress the default behavior of a piece of code at runtime without changing its original source code.
- It's simply the dynamic replacement of attributes at runtime. 
- Monkey patching is often considered a dangerous technique.

## Some etymology:
- The term monkey patch seems to have come from an earlier term, guerrilla patch, which referred to changing code sneakily ‚Äì and possibly incompatibly with other such patches ‚Äì at runtime. The word guerrilla, homophonous with gorilla (or nearly so), became monkey, possibly to make the patch sound less intimidating.
- An alternative etymology is that it refers to ‚Äúmonkeying about‚Äù with the code (messing with it).

If you add a new method to the `myObj` object, it's not monkey-patched. You won't see the console.log from `handleMethodCall`.
